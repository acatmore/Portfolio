		<h1> A little about my career so far </h1>
			<br>
			<p> 
				It has been a strange ride. Up until spring of 2015 I had been pursuing a career in law. 
				I had hoped to work in copyright law, but it became increasingly 
				clear that I wanted to make copyrightable content, not litigate it. 
				In my law school copyright course, special issues kept reapearing over online content. 
				The more I learned about the freedom of open-source software, the more I was enticed to try my hand at it.
				I began to use some of my limited free time to play around with javascript exercises on 
				<a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codeacademy</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khanacademy</a>. 
				I loved what I found, but the terrifying prospect of a career change loomed over my head.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				At the urging from a friend in the business, I pursued self-education for a few months.
				Eventually I needed some structure, but dreading the prospect of yet more school in my life, 
				I settled on an online bootcamp that came with a personal mentor. I completed the 
				<a href="https://www.bloc.io">Bloc</a> Frontend course over the summer. 
				It took me a while to realize that my frustration with the enormity of what 
				I did not know would always remain. However, in the end I have learned to love a career path with no concept of a ceiling. I have always had a thirst for learning.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am excited to finally work with web development in a professional setting.  My interests go far beyond the simple excution of web devlopment. I hope to gain an understanding of every aspect of delivering a quality product. This may mean learning more about the full stack, or about the motivations of company and consumers alike. More than anything I want to help make a product that has a real impact on the world.
