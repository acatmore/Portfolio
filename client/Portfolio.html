          <h2> <a href="#">Bloc Jams</a> </h2>
          <p>Is a music player that allows users to view and play their music collection. </p>
          <p>This was the main project of the online bootcamp Bloc. </p>
          <p>Through it I was able to learn some basic JQuery and AngularJS and their powerful control over a website's css.</p>

          <h2> <a href="https://github.com/acatmore/Bloclist">Acatmore Tasks</a> </h2>
            <p>Is a simple task list that allows users to classify priority levels, dismiss completed tasks, and set an expiration date for their tasks (default one week).</p>
            <p> For this project I had to learn to use Iron Router to manage multiple views.</p>
            <p> This was my first experience with Meteor and its dynamic templating. I find I really like the ability to manage html and javascript so cleanly.</p>

          <h2> <a href="http://civility.acatmore.com/">Civility</a> </h2> 
            <p> Is a Meteor project designed to help roommates organize their household expenses, and eventually their chores. The app's aim is to relieve the stress of financial accountability amongst roommates and keep things happy and civil. </p>
            <p> For this project I built multiple databases in MongoDB, and began to play around with dynamic CSS shapes.</p>
            <p> This project really expanded my knowledge of JS, HTML, and CSS. It is my personal project, and as such is a work-in-progress that continues to give me an outlet to learn from.</p>

            <p> Is made with Wordpress and Bootstrap and designed to organize a yearly public transportation conference from community leaders around the nation. This was another Brandography project.</p>
            <p> I curated and edited plugins to handle the many functions needed for the site, designed layout and styled the css.</p>
            <p> This was my introduction to Wordpress and the power a CMS. While, I felt the limitations of Wordpress's pre-designed plugins and interface during development, I realize the sheer amount of content contained in this website would have taken substantially longer without it.</p>

          <h2> <a href="http://fourwalla.com/">Fourwalla</a> </h2> 
            <p> Is a Meteor constructed website designed to be the Yelp for home construction contractors. I completed this project for my employer Brandography.</p>
            <p> For this project I did substantial bug fixes, added functionality, and secured the API.</p>
            <p> Working on this website allowed me a chance to dive into Meteor subscriptions and security.</p>
