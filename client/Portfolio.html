          <h2> <a href="https://github.com/acatmore/bloc-jams">Bloc Jams</a> </h2>
          <p>a music player that allows users to view and play their music collection. </p>
          <p>This was the main project of the online bootcamp Bloc. </p>
          <p>Through it I was able to learn some basic JQuery and AngularJS and their powerful control over a website's css.</p>

          <h2><a href="http://railvolution.org/">Railvolution</a></h2> 
            <p> a Wordpress designed website to organize a yearly public transportation conference from community leaders around the nation. I completed this project for my employer Brandography.</p>
            <p> I curated and edited plugins, designed the layout, and styled the css.</p>

          <h2> <a href="http://fourwalla.com/">Fourwalla</a> </h2> 
            <p>a Meteor constructed website designed to be the Yelp for home construction contractors.  This was another Brandography project.</p>
            <p> For this project I did substantial bug fixes, added functionality, and secured the API.</p>
            <p> Working on this website allowed me a chance to dive into Meteor subscriptions and security.</p>

            <p>a simple task list that allows users to classify priority levels, dismiss completed tasks, and set an expiration date for their tasks.</p>
            <p> For this project I had to learn to use Iron Router to manage multiple views.</p>
            <p> This was my first experience with Meteor and its dynamic templating. I find I really like the ability to manage html and javascript so cleanly.</p>

          <h2> <a href="https://github.com/acatmore/civility">Civility</a> </h2> 
            <p>a Meteor project designed to help roommates organize their household expenses, and eventually their chores. The app's aim is to relieve the stress of financial accountability amongst roommates and keep things happy and civil. </p>
            <p> For this project I built multiple databases in MongoDB, and began to play around with dynamic CSS shapes.</p>
            <p> This project really expanded my knowledge of JS, HTML, and CSS. It is my personal project, and as such is a work-in-progress that continues to give me an outlet to learn from.</p>
