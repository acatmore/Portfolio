			<h1> A little about my career so far </h1>
				<br>
				<p> 
					It has been a strange ride. Up until spring of 2015 I had been pursuing a career in law. 
					I had wanted to work in copyright law, but it became clear that I wanted to make 
					copyrightable content, not litigate it. The lifestyle simple was not for me.
					In my law school copyright course, special issues kept appearing around online content. 
					The more I learned about the freedom of the open-source community, the more I was enticed to try my hand at building something myself.
					I began to use some of my limited free time to play around with javascript exercises on 
					<a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codeacademy</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan academy</a>. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					At the urging from a friend in the business, I pursued self-education for a few months.
					Eventually I needed some structure, but dreading the prospect of yet more school in my life, 
					I settled on an online bootcamp that came with a personal mentor. I completed the 
					<a href="https://www.bloc.io">Bloc</a> Frontend course over the summer. 
					It took me a while to realize that my frustration with the enormity of what 
					I did not know would always remain. However, in the end I have learned to love a career path with no concept of a ceiling. I have always had a thirst for learning. Web development seems to find the focal point between creative expression and logical problem solving.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am excited to finally work with web development in a professional setting. My interests go far beyond the simple execution of web development. I hope to gain an understanding of every aspect of delivering a quality product. This may mean learning more about the full stack, or about the motivations of company and consumers alike. More than anything I want to help make a product that has a real impact on the world. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In January 2016 I started an internship at <a href="http://Brandography.com">Brandography</a>. Working there has greatly expanded my comfort level working with multple languages and tools. I've taken projects in all stages of development and helped push them to launch. The casual atmosphere combined with a strong emphasis on cooperation and time-management is a breath of fresh air compared to the solitary toils of law school. I love working with and learning from the more senior developers. Getting to see production from the perspective of our web designers, content writers, and business managment helps me feel the real value of my work.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was offered a fulltime positon at Brandography, but had to temper their eagerness to train on a junior devloper by telling them my plans to move to Seattle this year. Currently, I am planning to be in Seattle applying for positions in late April. I am open to remote work, and local employment there. I hope to find a humorous culture that matches my personality. On a personal level I deeply connected with the city of Seattle and its nerdy, yet active community. Regardless of where I find employment there you will find me working or writing short stories at coffee shops or finding my way to ski and hike every mountain I can.
