		    <h2>I am a web developer with an emphasis on the front end
		    </h2>
		    <p>I have been a tech enthusiast all my life. In college I had it in my head that I would be part of the cutting edge transition to the new world as a lawyer. I spent a year and a half in law school studying contract negotiation and copyright law, but ultimately decided that I would rather get in the trenches with the developers.</p>
		    <p>So over the last two years I have been making this transition. I took an online bootcamp, consulted developers I knew, built websites in my spare time, and secured myself an internship at the media marketing firm Brandography in Minneapolis doing mostly front-end work.</p>
		    <p>Four months into my internship I was offered a full time position at the company. I loved the people and the work, but I knew they needed someone who could commit for a year or more. In the end I turned down the offer so I could return to the state of my Alma Mater, Washington, for personal and career related reasons.</p>
		    <p>Now I am in Seattle teaching kids with Coding With Kids, and working with a friend on his cloud-based streaming and compositing open-source project Stream Kitchen, and picking up freelance positions on the side.</p>
