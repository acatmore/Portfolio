		    <h3>Law</h3><p> Before I came to programming I pursued the legal aspects of contracts and copyrights. For over a year I learned to represent clients' best interests. Ultimately, I decided that I would rather this knowledge suppliment a techinal background and left law school to cultivate my development skills.</p>
		    <h3>Education</h3><p>I pursued education online through indivual resources and an online front-end bootcamp through <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc</a>. I consumed articles on best practices and consulted professional developers to learn more. I secured myself an internship at the marketing media firm Brandography in Minneapolis and began making websites in a fast-paced deadline-driven environment.</p>
		    <h3>Now</h3><p>I am teaching in Seattle with Coding With Kids, and working with a friend on his cloud-based streaming and compositing open-source project <a href="https://github.com/streamkitchen/streamkitchen">Stream Kitchen</a>, as well as picking up freelance positions on the side. I continue to broaden my development knowledge through practice and research of the bleeding-edge of the field as well as diving into more.</p>
